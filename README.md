This rep contains all of my solutions to Advent of Code. Unless noted, 
the solutions and input-data are for the second part of the problem.

####Advent of Code   
is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. 
They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay 
sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. 
Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.
